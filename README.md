Adds new gamestart, "The Paranid Deserter"

*Following a successful bombing run in Holy Vision, you've deserted your squad and fled through a jumpgate to Faulty Logic. Although you've shaken most of your pursuers, you are bruised and deeply lost in Xenon space: your shields are busted, your navmap is corrupted, you're nearly out of ammo, and a search crew is hot on your tail. Worse: back home you're a traitor, a deserter, a thief, and a coward. The entire Paranid race is now out for your head! Luckily, your trusty Nemesis Vanguard is still in one piece, and it's loaded with stolen blueprints and Paranid tech. A worthy haul... but only if you get somewhere safe, fast.*

Built from salvaged bits and pieces of other mods and by poking around various game XML files. Special thanks to [CAS](https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=181&t=405102) for lots of useful samples to learn from.
