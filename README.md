Adds new gamestart, "The Paranid Deserter"

*Following a successful bombing run in Holy Vision, you and your crew have deserted your squad and fled through a jumpgate to Faulty Logic. Although it seems that you weren't followed, you are bruised and deeply lost in Xenon space -- your shields are busted your navigation data is corrupted, and you're nearly out of ammo. Worse: back home you're a traitor, a deserter, a thief, and a coward. Now every Paranid is out for your head. You command a fully-crewed ship with advanced blueprints and technology. Can you make it to safe haven? Can you find a new home?*

Built from salvaged bits and pieces of other mods and by poking around various game XML files. Special thanks to [CAS](https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=181&t=405102) for lots of useful samples to learn from.
